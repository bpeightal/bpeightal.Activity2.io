This is a simple website that is about me, Brandon Peightal.
My website includes two pages the first is a home page wich includes an image of me and a little bit about me.
There is a navagation bar on the top of the page where you can navigate between pages.
The second page is a page on employment it contains an image of the MCC logo and have a small bit about my experiences at each of these work places.
My pages are styled by a css file that help make things astetically pleasing to the website viewer.
I made sure to include a viewport at the top of my html so it will scale automatically to whatever device it is being viewed on.
