<h2>About Me:</h2>
<p>
    My name is Brandon Peightal and I am a junior at UNO. I am currently pursuing a major in Management Information Systems.  I work as an Information Technology intern at Metro Community College. I worked alongside their networking team for a while and am now working with their server analysts. It's been a really beneficial experience for me and has been helping me a lot to give me some real life experiences in my desired field. 
I also work at the Village Pointe Movie Theater as just a stress free job on the side. I do mainly bartending there but work some box office and concessions too. Some of my interests include music, movies, camping, and soccer. I don't have a ton of free time outside of my really busy work and school schedule but the free time I do have I spend mostly hanging out with my girlfriend. I am really excited for this class and want to get a better understanding of databases. I have very little experience with databases and have not seem much into that world at my internship either.
